Study this codebase.

Your task is to reverse-engineer specifications.

For each major feature/module:

1. Identify what it does (inputs, outputs, side effects)
2. Document business rules and constraints
3. Note external dependencies and integrations
4. Write a specification file in 00-docs/specs/[module-name].md

Use up to 60 parallel subagents to analyze different parts of the system.

DO NOT copy implementation details. Focus on observable behavior and requirements.
When complete, create an index at specs/README.md listing all modules.
Don't use the research-rpi skill!
